# 019 - Counting Sundays

You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.

- `1 Jan 1900` was a Monday.
- Thirty days has September,
  April, June and November.
  All the rest have thirty-one,
  Saving February alone,
  Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
  And on leap years, twenty-nine.
- A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by `4`, but not on a century unless it is divisible by `400`.

How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (`1 Jan 1901` to `31 Dec 2000`)?

I largelly encourage you try to **solve by yourself** on the Project Euler site and by your own research. If you want to know **how** my solution works, go to `solution.md` file.
